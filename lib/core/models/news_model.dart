        'NWSL and players association agree to abolish draft, raise player pay in new CBA',
    body:
        'The National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) and NWSL Players Association have a new collective bargaining agreement, one which includes higher pay, expanding benefits and – in a notable move – abolishing the draft.\n\nWith the new CBA, which will be in place through 2030, the NWSL becomes the first major American professional sports league to abolish its player draft.\n\n“The draft is an antiquated model that empowers teams to decide for Players instead of Players deciding for themselves,” NWSLPA president Tori Huster said.\n\n“Now, Players can choose the team environment that fits their needs and maximizes their opportunities. Teams will need to step up to create environments that appeal to Players.”\n\nThe agreement raises the minimum player salary, and there will be no limit for an individual player’s maximum salary. A team’s base salary cap will rise by nearly 55% over the term of the agreement from \$3.3 million in 2025 to \$5.1 million in 2030.\n\nParental leave and childcare benefits also will be further expanded under the new deal. Charter flights can be used for up to six legs in a league season, and additional charter flights are required in what the league says is “a variety of scenarios to ensure player health and safety requirements are satisfied.”\n\nPlayer movement also is addressed in the new CBA, granting unrestricted free agency and guaranteeing all contracts. Any trade, intra-league or inter-league transfer will require player consent. This, the league said in its statement announcing the CBA, aligns NWSL standard player agreements with FIFA regulations on the status and transfer of players.\n\n“Given our vision to be the best league in the world, we determined that this was the right time to align with global standards and achieve long term labor peace,” NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said.\n\n“This CBA gives us agency over our business and gives the players agency over their careers. Our new agreement revolutionizes the game, raises standards, and innovates the business.\n\n“On behalf of our Board of Governors, I want to thank our players and their representative leadership at the NWSLPA for working together to make this possible.”',

        'Grand Stade Hassan II: Design revealed for one of the world’s largest stadiums ahead of 2030 World Cup',
    body:
        'The final of the 2030 FIFA World Cup is five years and 11 months away, and the design for the stadium which hopes to host the match has finally been revealed.\n\nThe Grand Stade Hassan II soccer stadium in Morocco – one of three countries co-hosting the tournament alongside Spain and Portugal – is being touted as potentially “the largest football stadium in the world” by designers Oualolou + Choi and Populous, with a planned capacity of 115,000.\n\nThe stadium will be situated on a 100-hectare (roughly 247 acres) site in El Mansouria, a town north of Casablanca, with a design Populous says recalls a “moussem,” a type of traditional communal tent. The Grande Stade’s take will be made from an aluminum lattice, which will cover both fans inside the stadium and tiered gardens on the outside of the stands, and a botanical garden on the ground floor.\n\nThe design, according to Tarik Oualalou, design principal and founding partner at Oualalou + Choi, “is deeply rooted in Moroccan culture, with its traditions and contemporary expressions,” he wrote in a press release. “It is rooted in ancient and primordial figures: the Moussem, the tent, and the garden, as well as the topography and landscapes of Morocco.”\n\nThe configuration appears tailored for FIFA World Cup events: the stands themselves will be separated into zones for general admission fans at each end (holding nearly 30,000 each), while the main section will be dedicated to boxes, hospitality, VIPs and VVIPs, according to the release.\n\n“(It) will be a truly iconic, landmark venue for Morocco and for football itself, that will become one of the great stadia of the world,” said Christopher Lee, managing director at Populous, EMEA.\n\nSo how would the Grand Stade Hassan II stack up against other ludicrously capacious stadia?\n\nCricket can lay claim to having the largest stadium of all, the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India, which expanded to its massive 132,000 capacity in 2021, while the largest American football stadium belongs to the NCAA’s Michigan Wolverines, which hosts over 107,000 fans.\n\nThe world’s biggest soccer stadium is a multi-purpose venue and among the world’s most inaccessible: the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea. Opened in 1989, its official capacity is 150,000, although renovations in the 2010s spurred an investigation from website Stadium Database, which estimated the venue now seats a mere 114,000 fans.\n\nIs it a coincidence the Grande Stade Hassan II will have 1,000 more seats? Perhaps not.\n\nPopulous is no stranger to building large sporting structures: it was behind the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Emirates Stadium in London, a dozen Olympic venues and other stadia around the world.\n\nAfter five unsuccessful bids to host the FIFA World Cup, Morocco finally got its foot through the door when FIFA announced in October 2023 that the nation would co-host the 2030 finals alongside Spain and Portugal, in an unusual, elongated tournament setup that will also see one commemorative game played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay each to mark the FIFA World Cup’s centenary.\n\nThe Grande Stade Hassan II’s design team say the stadium will be “fully compliant for FIFA competitions” and will have “the ability to host the final” of the 2030 World Cup; the final decision on which location FIFA will choose is still pending, though Real Madrid’s newly renovated Estadio Santiago Bernabéu is widely expected to be the favorite.\n\nPreparations for groundworks at the site outside Casablanca have begun, say Oualolou + Choi and Populous, so expect to see this grand design brought to life in the coming years.',

    title: 'Quiz! Can you name every Premier League club ever?',
    body:
        'It\'s our football quiz of the day – and we want you to name every Premier League club in the history of the competition..\n\nYou don\'t need us to tell you that this is the single greatest top tier in world football.\n\nIt\'s partly because of the talent – the fact that our shores have welcomed the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry over the years, nurturing them into stars. It\'s the great managers, the amazing eras of continent-dominating sides. But it\'s also the characters. The Pulises and the Pearsons, the Robbie Savages, Mike Deans and Jimmy Bullards.\n\nThe only league in the world considered to be the best where John Carver can claim he\'s the greatest coach in the league. Where David De Gea has a chant to the tune of Weather With You by Crowded House. Where we can broadcast two teams who can\'t hit a barn door on a prime TV slot on at the weekend and have the cheek to call it Super Sunday. Where Harry Redknapp can tip Wes Morgan for an England cap, despite the fact he\'s played in a Copa America.\n\nThe Premier League isn\'t always good, but it\'s always great. Today, we\'d like you to name every club that\'s ever been a part of it, since its inception in 1992.',
